webSockets established a full duplex i.e bi-directional communication channel between the client and server.
which implies the server does't need to wait for the client to send a request before sending a response. 
websocket can send data back to the client independently without any requests. It’s like a phone call. You don’t have to wait for anyone to speak first and only then, reply back. Anyone can speak in any order without waiting for each other.
